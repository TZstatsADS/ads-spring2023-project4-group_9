+ Project summary: In this project, we implemented fairness algorithms in two papers:Fairness-aware Classifier with Prejudice Remover Regularizer (A5) and Handling Conditional Discrimination(A6). We applied the algorithms to COMPAS dataset to see which algorithm has a higher accuracy and also gives fairer results. The result shows that Fairness-aware Classifier with Prejudice Remover Regularizer (A5) gives the best results with the lowest calibration score and reasonable accuracy
